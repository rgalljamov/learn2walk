### Details on the Motion Capturing Data

The mocap dataset *Trajecs_Constant_Speed_400Hz.mat* contains the trajectories of the knee, ankle and hip joint as well as COM and trunk kinematics in Cartesian coordinates. The trajectories are split into individual steps. A step starts with the touchdown of a foot and ends with the touchdown of the opposite foot. The dataset contains 35 steps of constant speed walking at 1.5m/s. The processed data is provided with a sample frequency of 400Hz.
